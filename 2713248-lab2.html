            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am final CS student at Wits University with a keen interest in web development nurtured over the past 3 years of mathing and coding. I am cool, fun, smart and weird - what my friends would say. I enjoy music and looking like I could solve the Climate change issues while I can't even center a div. Hehe. Tennis is my favourite sport (don't ask why).</p>

            <h3>Latest Project</h3>
            <p>I built a personal website that acts as a digital vault where I keep interesting things I found online while either scrolling on Instagram, Tiktok or Pinterest. It also stores music I found deeply fire. I used CSS and HTML to built the website.</p>
